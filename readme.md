# Interact with AWS using the boto API and python. 
by Stephen Coady (Applied Computing)
## Instructions to run

To run this program, you must have boto installed and your keys properly configured in your .boto file in the home folder.

After that, python is also required to run this program. 

### To run: the command is "python3 run_newwebserver.py"

### Note: 
This program assumes you have your private key for connecting to instances saved in the same directory as the program is running from. Simply move the key to the current directory, tell the program what it is called when it asks and then it will look after the rest.
